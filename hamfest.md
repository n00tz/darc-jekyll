# In Memoriam

Harold Jones (N4BD) Our Hamfest Chairman  became a SK on 12/27/11. Words can't describe the passion he had for Ham Radio, The Dalton Amateur Radio Club, and The Dalton Hamfest. He had a unique personality which he shared with family and friends. If you knew Harold, the photo below shows his sense of humor. He was a "ford guy". All DARC Hamfest are dedicated to N4BD SK
